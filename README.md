The app was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) as the bundler and dev server and the React template:
```shell
npm create vite@latest name-of-your-project -- --template react
# follow prompts
cd <your new project directory>
npm install <your dependencies>
npm run dev
```
Icons created with [Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net).  

The service worker was generated with [Vite Plugin PWA](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/guide/). It was used to: 
- Generate the manifest.
- Configure the manifest with a link in the `head` of the app entry point.
- Generate a service worker.
- Generate a script to register the sw.
See [here](https://github.com/vite-pwa/vite-plugin-pwa/blob/main/src/types.ts) for details on the plugin options.  

To install the plugin:
```shell
npm i vite-plugin-pwa -D
```
